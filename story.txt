-	In a land long since forgotten, disasters ravaged the once prosperous people. The skies replete with smoke darkend, obscuring the sun. Crops withered and burned. Whirlwinds wrecked havoc and quakes tore the earth asunder.
	In a land long since forgotten, disasters ravaged the once prosperous people. The skies replete with smoke darkend, obscuring the sun. Crops withered and burned. Whirlwinds wrecked havoc and quakes tore the earth asunder. Blizzards from the mountains to the north froze whatever remained.
	Those who survived sent an old man away from their ruined land to seek the aid of a hero. He gives the wanderer a blessed sword. Desperatly he begs the hero to go to the Demon Tower and kill its lord. 
	This towers magic is the perpetuator of the blights across the land.  To best the demon lord, the hero must first counquer the demons serving him in the lower floors and seal their souls. To save this land, they must climb the Demon Tower.
